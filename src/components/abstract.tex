\section*{Abstract}
The Job Description Generator is a novel software solution developed in collaboration with the \glsxtrfull{ipa}. The system is designed to automate and streamline the process of creating detailed and comprehensive job descriptions, leveraging the power of AI.

The project had two primary objectives. The first was to develop a user-friendly interface that allows HR Managers to define roles and responsibilities effectively. This involved creating functionalities for selecting job categories, specialized fields, skills, and tasks, and generating a job description based on these selections.

The second objective was to integrate the system with advanced AI technologies. The system uses the GPT-3 API to generate comprehensive and detailed job descriptions based on the selected job category, skills, and tasks. This AI integration ensures that the job descriptions are accurate, relevant, and tailored to the specific needs of the job.

Additionally, the system was integrated with a chatbot, providing users with guidance and assistance in understanding the system better and navigating the job description creation process.

The final product is a robust, efficient, and user-friendly solution that simplifies the process of creating job descriptions, thereby enhancing productivity and effectiveness in HR departments.
