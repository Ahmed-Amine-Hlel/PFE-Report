\section{Requirements Analysis and Specifications}
The Requirement Specifications provide a comprehensive outline of what the software must do and how it should perform. They are categorized into functional and non-functional requirements. These requirements are informed by the needs of the actors or users of the software, and the desired capabilities of the system.

\subsection{Identification of the Actors}
The iCD toolset web application will cater to a broad range of actors, each with their own specific needs and expectations. These actors can be grouped into three main categories: Companies/Organizations, Individuals, and Educational Institutions.

    \caption{  Logo Of Dart }
    \label{fig: Dart_Logo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Back-End Technology Choice}
The back-end of the application was developed using {\color{purple}JavaScript} with the {\color{purple}Express.js} framework. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It's widely used for creating and controlling web pages, making it a fundamental technology for web development.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{  Logo Of Algolia }
    \label{fig: Algolia_Logo}
\end{figure}


For the automated generation of job descriptions and for the interactive chatbot feature, the team utilized the {\color{purple}GPT-3.5 Turbo API} from OpenAI. The GPT API provides a general-purpose "text in, text out" interface, making it easy to apply the capabilities of the models to a wide range of tasks. The use of system context related to the iCD toolset ensured that the chatbot provided related and helpful information to the users.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

\end{figure}

With these technologies combined, We were able to build an efficient and user-friendly application that simplifies the use of the iCD toolset.


\section{Proposed architecture}
\subsection{General Presentation of the Proposed Solution}

% The proposed solution is a web application designed to simplify the usage of the iCD toolset, which is a comprehensive set of task and skill dictionaries. The iCD toolset comes in its raw form as Excel files and graphs, making it challenging to interact with and extract relevant information. Our web application addresses this challenge by importing, filtering, and structuring the iCD toolset data into a user-friendly format.

% The primary users we focused on for the sake of this application MVP (Minimum Viable Product) are Human Resource Managers, who use the application to define job descriptions. These users can select a job from a series of dropdown menus, and the application will display the skills required for the selected job. Users can then filter and search for the desired skills using the Algolia search engine, which we have integrated into our application. After the skills are selected, the application fetches and displays the tasks related to those skills. Users can then generate a job description, which is created using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from OpenAI. All generated job descriptions are stored in a Firestore database and can be updated or deleted as required.

% In addition to these features, the application includes a chatbot that uses the GPT-API to provide context-specific information about the iCD toolset to the users.

Our web application simplifies the iCD toolset, originally in Excel files and graphs, by making the data user-friendly. The MVP focuses on Human Resource Managers, enabling them to define job descriptions. Users can select jobs from dropdown menus, view required skills, and use the Algolia search engine for skill filtering. The application shows tasks related to selected skills and generates job descriptions via the GPT-3.5 Turbo model from OpenAI. Generated descriptions are stored in a Firestore database for updating or deletion. A GPT-API-powered chatbot is included for context-specific iCD toolset information.


\subsection{General Architecture}

The application's architecture is designed with a focus on simplifying the interaction between the user and the iCD toolset data. It consists of several key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Front-End: Built with FlutterFlow, our front-end enables HR managers to select jobs, view, filter, and search skills, choose related tasks, and generate job descriptions.
    \item Back-End: Leveraging JavaScript and Express.js, our back-end structures the raw iCD data and exposes it via APIs hosted on Render.
    \item Database: The application uses two databases: Airtable and Firestore. The iCD toolset data is imported and filtered into an Airtable database, while Firestore is used to store user information and generated job descriptions.
    \item Third-Party Services: The application uses several third-party services. Algolia is used to create an index of all skill items and task items and provide search capabilities. The GPT-3.5 Turbo model from OpenAI is used to generate job descriptions. Firebase is used for user authentication and data storage.
    \item Chatbot: A chatbot is included in the application to provide users with context-specific information about the iCD toolset. The chatbot also uses the GPT-API from OpenAI and is designed to provide suggestions that are updated based on the user's interactions with the application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Preparation, Setup, and Manipulation}
% The primary aim of the project was to design and implement a system that enables {\color{newBlue}\textbf{HR}} managers to effectively define job roles and responsibilities using the IT Competency Dictionary (iCD). 
% The iCD, a comprehensive toolset developed in Japan, consists of a {\color{darkPurple}\textbf{Task Dictionary}} outlining specific IT business tasks and a {\color{darkgreen}\textbf{Skill Dictionary}} detailing the necessary IT skills required to perform these tasks. 
% This toolset, originally provided in Excel format, contains essential elements from three previous skill standards in Japan, making it a comprehensive resource for defining IT job roles and responsibilities.
The project's primary goal was to create a system that allows {\color{newBlue}\textbf{HR}} managers to effectively define job roles using the IT Competency Dictionary (iCD). The iCD, a comprehensive toolset from Japan, includes a {\color{darkPurple}\textbf{Task Dictionary}} and a {\color{darkgreen}\textbf{Skill Dictionary}}. Originally in Excel format, the iCD integrates elements from three previous Japanese skill standards, making it a valuable resource for defining IT roles.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Task 1: \\
          Import the raw ICD toolset data into the Airtable database with necessary modifications.
    \item Task 2: \\
          Create and deploy a web server that fetches and structures the data from the Airtable database.
    \item Task 3: \\
          Integrate the web server into the FlutterFlow application to use the structured data.
    \item Task 4: \\
          Develop and implement functions and actions to display and manipulate the data as required for the specific use case.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Data Setup}

To effectively utilize the iCD toolset, the first step was to import the raw data into {\color{limeGreen}\textbf{Airtable}}, a cloud-based database management system. 
This required converting the Excel-based iCD toolset into a format compatible with Airtable. 
During this process, the data was also meticulously cleaned and reorganized to suit the project's specific requirements. \\
$ \rightarrow $ \quad For instance, duplicate entries were removed, errors in the data were corrected, and data fields were restructured to optimize retrieval and analysis in later stages of the project.

\subsection{Web Service}

Following the successful import of data into Airtable, a {\color{limeGreen}\textbf{web service}} was developed to interact with this data. 
This service, designed using Node.js (or another suitable technology), was tasked with fetching data from Airtable and structuring it in a way that would facilitate easy manipulation and display on the front-end application. 
This involved processes such as validation of the fetched data, as well as sorting and filtering to ensure the most relevant data was sent to the front-end. 
Once developed, this service was deployed on Render, making it accessible for use by the FlutterFlow application.


\subsection{FlutterFlow Integration}
After deploying the web server, it was integrated into the {\color{limeGreen}\textbf{FlutterFlow application}}. 
This entailed establishing a reliable connection between the server and the application, and ensuring that the application could send requests to, and receive responses from, the server correctly. 
A vital part of this integration was to ensure the structured data provided by the server was correctly handled and displayed within the FlutterFlow application, allowing for a seamless user experience.

\subsection{Data Manipulation}

With the data pipeline fully established, attention was turned to developing features within the application that allowed users to interact with the iCD data. 
This encompassed creating {\color{limeGreen}\textbf{functions}} to display data effectively within the application, and designing actions that let users manipulate the data, such as sorting or filtering functions. 
Each of these functions was thoroughly tested to ensure they worked as expected, allowing users to navigate and manipulate the data effectively according to their specific use case.

\subsection{ICD Project Management Canva and Mindmap}

During the setup process, a {\color{limeGreen}\textbf{project management Canva}} and a {\color{limeGreen}\textbf{Mindmap}} were created. These visual tools were instrumental in gaining a deep  
understanding of the complex structure of the iCD toolset and its nested structure. 
They served as useful references during the data import and manipulation phase, as well as throughout the development of the front-end application.
